			<p>Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcoholbased hand rub or wash them with soap and water.
               Why? Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands.</p>

			<div><h2 id="social">distancing</h2></div>
			<p>Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing.
               Why? When someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid
			   droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you
			   are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the
			   COVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease. </p>

		<section class="Avoid_touch" >
			<div><h2 id="Avoid">Avoid touch</h2></div>
			<p>Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth. Why? Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses.
               Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and
               can make you sick</p>
